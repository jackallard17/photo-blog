title: Whidbey Island
description: A beautiful Sun-day trip! After waking up late, we hopped in the car to Anacortes to grab some of the best muffins ever at "The Store." From there, we drove south towards Whidbey Island (we grabbed some popcorn shrimp on the way as a snack). The bulk of the afternoon was spent at Deception Pass State Park, where we got our fill of beach time, and spotted a 'bob' of seals! We were hopeful that one of them would make landfall near us, but we must have scared them away with our zany vibes. On our way south, we made a short visit to Fort Casey State Park, which contains a sprawling complex of abandoned military bunkers, which were constructed from 1897-1901. While cool and historic, this place kind of creeped me out, with its narrow, dank, stalactite-ridden hallways. Elena had to save me from the scary birds that patrolled the tunnels. To finish the day, we caught the sunset ferry from Clinton to Mukilteo, completing the loop.
