title: Blue on Blue
description: A nice little saturday trek up to the mountains :) The gloomy grip of winter seems to be finally loosening up. The sky was blue, the sun was hitting the trees and causing snow to melt off of them, with the pitter patter sound of melting snow audible in every direction. Barely any wind, near perfect visibility. Mt. Rainier and Mt. Adams were visible on the horizon. Take that seasonal depression!
