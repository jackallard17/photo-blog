title: Snowy Camping on the N. Fork John Day River
description: What a beautiful outing! The full moon was out in full force, reflecting off of the light dusting of snow that was on the ground. During the day, I was able to get some cool shots of the partially frozen river. Included also in this album are some photos from the drive. I hopped off I-84 at Baker City before heading to Sumpter, then on through Granite on NF-73 (a new route for me!) On the way  back to Walla Walla I continued on this route, where I photographed a beautiful homestead on a massive slice of pasture land nestled in this quiet corner of the blues. Finally, I re-connected with the interstate at Hilgard junction.
