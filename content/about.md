This site is a photography blog as well as an experiment in a few new skills I am trying to pick up. The site is generated using Hugo using [Nico Kaiser's gallery theme](https://github.com/nicokaiser/hugo-theme-gallery), and deployed via Github Actions.

What is cool about this approach is that to add photos to this site, I just put them into the repo's local directory on my computer and commit/push the changes to GitHub! Each album has an associated Markdown file where I can write whatever I want before Hugo converts the .md file to the HTML that you are seeing!
