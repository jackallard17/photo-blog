title: Dropping in at Big Sur
description: Here is a collection of photos from my recent road trip down to California. The focal point of this trip was a visit to the Esalen Institute, where I participated in the "Go Within" weekend workshop. The theme of the workshop was 'dropping in,' that is, dropping focus and attention inward for the new year. I spent the weekend in meditation/yoga classes, soaking in the hot springs, and meeting new people! There are also some photos in this collection from my time camping on the Sonoma coast before the retreat and visiting Santa Cruz on my way back from Big Sur.
